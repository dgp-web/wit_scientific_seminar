# webpack-sample

This sample demonstrates that a single build dependency to the npm package **webpack**
introduces 322 overall dependencies from 197 maintainers to a project.

## Setup

This sample requires an installation of [Node.JS >= 12.14.0](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**Step 01**: Install the project dependencies via ``npm install``. 

When the installation is complete, the number of installed packages and the number
of maintainers are printed to the console.

**Step 02** (optional): List the dependency tree of all installed packages via ``npm ls``.
